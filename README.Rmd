The ambition of kflow is to make it easier to build R code that is orchestrated by Google's [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/). 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ndiquattro/kflow")
```
## Example

Coming soon!
